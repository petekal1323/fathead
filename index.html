					<h3>Transform your childs bedroom</h3>
					<p>
						Fathead is the gift that provides cheer and overwhelming excitement on birthdays or holidays. As it is unwrapped, your child will be amazed at the vibrant images of their favorite character, superstar athlete or an awe-inspiring animal. The detail captured in a Fathead will spark your child's imagination and have them playing along with the Fathead once it is on their wall. As seen in the video, Fathead causes reactions that have not been witnessed since the Turbo-Man doll.

						Once you have the space picked out, the installation is a breeze. The majority of Fatheads go up as easy as peel-and-stick. However, there are also transfer decals (these will have “Rub On Transfer” stated on the product page) that have more intricate designs. Because of their more detailed designs, transfer wall decals are applied using the transfer method, (read more) instead of a peel-and-stick.
